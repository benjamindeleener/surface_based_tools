# partial_volume_correction
Partial Volume Effect (PVE) hampers the accuracy of studies aiming at mapping MRI signal in the cortex due to the close proximity of adjacent white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The proposed framework addresses this issue by disentangling the various sources of MRI signal within each voxel, assuming three classes (WM, gray matter, CSF) within a small neighbourhood. This tool allow accurate extraction of MRI metrics using surface-based analysis. This tool can be particularly useful for probing pathology in outer or inner cortical layers, which are subject to strong PVE with adjacent CSF or WM.
