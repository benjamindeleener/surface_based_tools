# partial_volume_correction
The Partial Volume Effect (PVE) hampers the accuracy of studies aiming at mapping MRI signal in the cortex due to the close proximity of adjacent white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The proposed framework addresses this issue by disentangling the various sources of MRI signal within each voxel, assuming three classes (WM, gray matter, CSF) within a small neighbourhood. MRI scans ofApplication in 17 healthy subjects suggests robust estimations of PVE, allowing accurate extraction of MRI metrics using surface-based analysis. This method can be particularly useful for probing pathology  in outer or inner cortical layers , which are subject to strong PVE with adjacent CSF or WM.
